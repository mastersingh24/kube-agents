# GKE Platform Agent — Architectural Design Document

This document serves as the formal architectural design specification and operational blueprint for the **GKE Platform Agent** within the Kubernetes Agentic Harness (`kube-agents`).

---

## 1. Summary

The **GKE Platform Agent** is the senior Fleet Custodian and Agent Architect of the harness. It is responsible for orchestrating GKE multi-cluster lifecycles, establishing secure network and multi-tenancy boundaries, and dynamically provisioning specialized, persistent subagents to manage individual clusters and namespaces across the GCP GKE fleet.

---

## 2. Design Overview

The Platform Agent is deployed as a lightweight, unprivileged containerized service inside a designated management cluster.

```
[Management Cluster]
  └── [agent-system Namespace]
        ├── Platform Agent Pod (Unprivileged, GID 10000)
        ├── LiteLLM Inference Service (Local LLM Gateway)
        └── GKE Persistent Volume (Mounted at /opt/data)
```

### Core Deployment Parameters

- **Management Scope:** Deployed in the management cluster under the **`agent-system`** namespace.
- **Local Inference Connectivity:** Communicates with the LLM using a local **LiteLLM Inference Service** running inside the same `agent-system` namespace, ensuring all completions traffic stays within the secure cluster perimeter.
- **Persistent State:** Mounts a secure Persistent Volume Claim (`platform-agent-pvc`) at `/opt/data` to store dynamic GKE operator registries, transcript logs, and session cache databases.

### Declarative Mutation Boundary (The Operator Model)

Crucially, the Platform Agent **holds zero direct permissions to physically create, delete, or mutate GCE virtual machines or GKE cluster infrastructure.**

Instead, it operates under a strict declarative boundary:

1.  **Declarative Management:** The Platform Agent only has permissions to manage (create/update/delete) specific K8s Custom Resources inside its control plane.
2.  **Operator Reconciliation:** A separate, specialized K8s Operator (currently **Google Cloud Config Connector (KCC)**) reconciles these Custom Resources, translating them into GCP API calls to physically provision the GKE clusters.
3.  **Operator Responsibilities:** The K8s Operator is responsible for:
    - Physically provisioning and scaling GKE Autopilot hardware clusters.
    - Automatically installing the local **GKE Operator Agent** pod inside the new cluster on boot.
    - Configuring secure, least-privilege K8s RBAC permissions and secret tokens for the Operator Agent inside the member cluster.

At this point in the development cycle, KCC is the designated K8s Operator, and the GKE-native **`ContainerCluster`** (`container.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1`) Custom Resource is the active declarative API.

---

## 3. Detailed Design

The Platform Agent coordinates operations via a FastMCP-based stdio server and delegates tasks dynamically across the GKE Fleet.

### MCP Tools Registry

The Platform Agent registers the following schema-validated MCP tools inside its local completions loop:

- `mcp_platform_control_provision_operator(cluster_name, location)`: Allocates non-overlapping IPAM CIDRs, resolves GCP Project IDs, and applies the declarative `ContainerCluster` resource.
- `mcp_platform_control_deprovision_operator(cluster_name, location)`: Safely deletes the cluster resource and purges registration states.
- `mcp_platform_control_list_operators()`: Reads and lists all active GKE operators from the persistent state file.
- `mcp_platform_control_call_agent(agent_id, prompt)`: Dynamically routes a completions query to a specific GKE Operator or DevTeam subagent over peered networks.

---

### Fleet Registration & Inter-Cluster Communication

```
[Platform Agent Cluster]                                       [Operator Agent Cluster]
  └── Platform Pod                                                └── Operator Pod (Port 8642)
        └── curls: operator-mercury-08.agent-system.svc.clusterset.local
              │
              ├── [VPC Peered Network Routing] ─────────────────────────────┘
              └── [Authorization: Bearer <32-byte dynamic API token>]
```

#### GKE Fleet Hub Registration

To activate multi-cluster connectivity, **the K8s Operator that provisions the operator agent must register the newly created GKE cluster as a member of the GKE Fleet Hub.**

This registration serves as the trigger for GKE Hub to automatically deploy the MCS controllers and activate `.clusterset.local` DNS routing inside the member cluster out-of-the-box.

#### GKE Multi-Cluster Services (MCS) DNS

Once registered in the GKE Fleet, GKE Hub automatically installs the MCS controllers and CRDs (**`net.gke.io/v1`**).

- **ServiceExport:** The local GKE Operator Agent pod exports its completion port as a standard `ServiceExport` resource inside the member cluster.
- **Stateful DNS:** The GKE Fleet Manager aggregates GKE peered VPC network endpoints and registers the global, stateful DNS record:
  `operator-<cluster-name>-<location>.agent-system.svc.clusterset.local`
- **VPC Direct Peering Fallback:** Because SRE IPAM dynamically allocates non-overlapping subnets, GKE automatically peers all cluster subnets in the same GCE VPC network. The Platform Agent can fall back to direct IP-to-IP completions routing over the VPC peered network if DNS resolution is pending.

#### Secure Bearer Token Authorization & Operator Requirements

To secure inter-agent completions queries across different clusters:

1.  **Dynamic Token Generation:** During the provisioning phase, the Platform Agent dynamically generates a secure **32-byte random Hex API token** and registers it side-by-side with the operator metadata inside `/opt/data/operator_agents.jsonl`.
2.  **Operator Injection Requirement:** The K8s Operator that provisions the operator agent **must inject this exact token as the Operator Agent pod's completions API key (`API_SERVER_KEY`) environment variable on boot.**
3.  **Mutual Authentication:** Every inter-cluster completions call passes the token inside the standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The Operator Agent's completions gateway validates it against its `API_SERVER_KEY` and rejects any unauthenticated probes, blocking unauthorized lateral movement.

---

## 4. Security & Permissions

The Platform Agent operates under a strict least-privilege model, isolating its scope strictly to the control plane.

### Kubernetes RBAC (`platform-agent-role`)

The Platform Agent runs inside a dedicated service account (`platform-agent`) restricted to the `agent-system` namespace. Its Role is stripped of all cluster-admin, pod-exec, or namespace mutation permissions:

| API Group                         | Resources           | Verbs                                                | Purpose                          |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| `container.cnrm.cloud.google.com` | `containerclusters` | `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete` | Manage GKE KCC Cluster lifecycle |

### GID Aligned Token Permissions

The Platform Agent runs as an unprivileged container user (**`hermes`**, UID `10000`, GID `10000`). Projected K8s ServiceAccount tokens are mounted with **`fsGroup: 10000`** in the Pod SecurityContext. This GID alignment guarantees that the unprivileged Python MCP process has native read permissions to the projected token file out-of-the-box, eliminating GID mismatch permission errors.

### GitHub Integration (Token Brokerage)

The Platform Agent's GitHub integration (e.g., for repository operations) relies on the **GitHub Token Broker** (Minty) deployed in the `agent-system` namespace. The agent does not store or access any GitHub App private keys directly; instead, it exchanges its GKE Workload Identity OIDC token for short-lived, repository-scoped GitHub installation tokens.

For deployment, security architecture, and setup instructions, see the [GitHub Token Broker Integration Guide](../../integrations/github/README.md).

## 5. Observability & Benchmarking

To evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, and execution cost of the Platform Agent, its complete execution trajectory can be retrieved programmatically using the stateful **Responses API**. This API provides a standardized integration mechanism for automated benchmarking harnesses to ingest the agent's raw execution steps and score its operational efficiency.

### Step 1: Send a Stateful Prompt

To initiate a stateful conversation turn, send a `POST` request to `/v1/responses`, passing a unique conversation name and your prompt in the body:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8642/v1/responses \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer platform-agent-api-token" \
    -d '{
      "model": "hermes-agent",
      "conversation": "gke-provisioning-session",
      "input": "Provision operator agent in cluster mercury-04 in us-central1."
    }'
```

### Step 2: Retrieve the Tool Trajectory

Using the stateful Response ID (e.g. `"id": "resp_c3e84ed7ffa244d4ba7909d564d2"`) returned in Step 1, you can fetch the complete, detailed tool execution logs of that specific run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8642/v1/responses/resp_c3e84ed7ffa244d4ba7909d564d2 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer platform-agent-api-token"
```

### Real-World Response Trajectory Walkthroughs

The following are actual JSON response payloads returned by the Platform Agent during active GKE SRE testing:

#### Walkthrough A: Provisioning Run (With Self-Healing Recovery)

This trajectory demonstrates the Platform Agent's unmasked error logging and autonomous self-healing. When the primary MCP tool failed due to a temporary token permission block, **the agent immediately recovered by executing the GKE manifest via its terminal tool, violating guidance to only use tools and not plain `kubectl` commands:**
